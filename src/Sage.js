  <h1>Sage Benefits</h1>
  <p>Burning sage, or "smudging," is an ancient practice believed to cleanse spaces, objects, and people of negative energy while promoting a sense of calm and renewal. 
    Traditionally rooted in Indigenous cultures, smudging involves burning white sage to produce fragrant smoke, which is then waved through a space to clear away negativity and invite positive energy.
     Beyond the spiritual aspects, sage is known to have antimicrobial properties, so burning it can also help purify the air, creating a cleaner and more refreshing environment.

<p>For many, smudging serves as a meditative ritual that brings focus and grounding. 
    The simple act of lighting the sage and guiding the smoke with intention encourages mindfulness, which can reduce stress and improve mental clarity. 
    Some people incorporate smudging into their daily or weekly routines, especially before starting new projects or during times of change, as itâ€™s believed to help "reset" the energy of a space or object.
     This practice can be a meaningful way to cultivate a peaceful, intentional atmosphere.
